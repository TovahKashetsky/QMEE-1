title: Course description
---

This course focuses on realistic quantitative modeling of lab and field
data.Â  The main activity is learning to fit models to data using a
statistical package and programming language called R. In this applied
context, the course will visit a variety of philosophical topics:
parsimony vs. realism, Bayesian vs. frequentist statistics, estimation
vs. hypothesis testing. The course will enhance your ability to ask
interesting biological questions with a quantitative flavor; and to
construct, parameterize, and test models for your own data.
