Intro
=====

We will be talking about visualizing your data, with an emphasis on
`ggplot2`, which is based on the Grammar of Graphics.

Goals
=====

-   Participants will learn to think broadly about effective uses of visualization
-   Participants will learn about the Cleveland hierarchy and research on effective visualization techniques
-   Participants will be introduced to [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org)

Resources
=========

-   Course material
    -   [ Lecture notes](Visualization_Lecture_notes.html)
    -   [ R code: homicide example](CA_homicide_pix.html)
    -   [ R code: contraception example](Visualization_Contraception.html)

-   [ggplot](http://ggplot2.org)
-   [Cleveland hierarchy](http://sfew.websitetoolbox.com/post/clevelands-graphical-features-hierarchy-4598555)
-   Graphics design pioneer [Edward Tufte](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/)

Exercise
========

* Construct some (i.e., more than one) ggplots using your data. Discuss:
	* what you are trying to show
	* some of the choices that you have made
	* the basis for these choices (e.g., Cleveland hierarchy, proximity of comparisons, or other principles of graphical communication) 

* See the [assignment instructions](../admin/assignments.html)

You should put your code on GitHub in some form. Make sure that the
code has no local commands (like `setwd()`) and just runs from beginning
to end. You can test this by clearing your R workspace and running it
from beginning to end.
