title: "Topic: Data management"
---

Goals
=====

-   We will discuss some principles of data management, data flow and
    reproducible research
-   Participants will continue to practice with R, and will examine
    their data and make some products

Resources
=========

-   [Managing data in R](tips/Managing_data_in_R.html)
	- [Lecture notes](lectures/cleaning.html); [slides](lectures/cleaning.slides.html)
-   [Managing projects in R](tips/Managing_projects_in_R.html)
-   [More bits and pieces](tips/More_bits_and_pieces.html)

Also: [OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org)  ([Data Carpentry lesson](https://datacarpentry.org/OpenRefine-ecology-lesson/))

Preparation
-----------

In the second hour of Wednesday's class we will be working to get you set up with Git and Github, following [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](http://happygitwithr.com/). 

If possible, before Monday's class:

- Register a GitHub account: you can just go straight to https://github.com to do this (by clicking on either of the green "Sign up" buttons). The one thing you may want to read first is [this advice on picking a GitHub user name](http://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html).
- if you're on MacOS, it would be helpful to install XCode ahead of time (https://developer.apple.com/download/). If you are using an old version of MacOS, ask for help.
- it will also be helpful to install the `tidyverse` suite of R packages: 
  * within an R session, type `install.packages("tidyverse")`
  * (*or* you can do this via the package manager window in RStudio).

Exercise
========

* Examine the structure of the data you imported 
* Examine the data for mistakes, and to make sure you understand the R classes
* Make one or two plots that might help you see whether your data have any errors or anomalies
* Describe what sort of investigations you might do with your data, and how you might break your project into replicable components: save this in your repo as a file called `README.md`
* Make sure you know how to use `source`, `save` and `load` in R: finish a task, and then close R without saving your workspace and efficiently redo the task.
* See the [assignment instructions](admin/assignments.html)
