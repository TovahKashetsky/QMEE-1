Sorry we are having issues with git!

* Please:
	* Do not click the "amend" button -- it's just a trap!
	* Tell us your directory name (not your github name, unless they're the same)
	* Tell us your commit ID
		* this will pop up next to the word "master" when you commit.
	* do not stage any pointless files, and do not stage anything outside your own directory.
		* Let us know if you want to "ignore" files in your own directory
