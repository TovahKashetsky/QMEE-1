title: "Week 1: Introduction to R"
---

Preparation
===========

-   Ideally, you should bring a laptop to class. If you can't, we'll
    work something out, but you definitely need access to a computer on
    which you can install and run the software that we will be using for
    the class

Before Monday
----------------

*   Install and run the free (and open-source) program `R` from the links at the top of [the Comprehensive R Archive Network](http://cran.r-project.org/).
	 * If you have an older version of R (< 3.5.2), *please update to the latest version*.

* Install and run the free (and open-source) R
    development environment `RStudio` from the Download button at the
    [RStudio web site](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/). You want the
    "desktop" version.

* install the `tidyverse` suite of R packages: 
  * within an R session, type `install.packages("tidyverse")`
  * (*or* use the package manager window in RStudio).

Before Wednesday
----------------

* [Sign up for a github account](https://github.com) (click the big green "Sign up for GitHub" button)
	* You may want to read [this advice on picking a GitHub user name](http://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html) first.
* If you're on MacOS, try to [install XCode](https://developer.apple.com/download/).
* e-mail your GitHub account name to <bio708qmee@gmail.com>
* Get as far as you can through the following steps:
    * Read and follow the directions in chapters 1-7 (most of them are short!) in Jenny Bryan's [Happy Git with R](https://happygitwithr.com/)
* If you have trouble with any of this, you can get help on Wednesday
	
Goals
=====

*   An introduction to the R environment, and some basic principles of
    scripting and programming

*   Participants will install and run R, write a script, and read some
    data

Resources
=========

*   The official Introduction to R on the [R manuals
    page](http://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html)

*   Course material
    *   [Lecture notes](intro_Lecture_notes.html)
    *   [tidyverse](intro_tidyverse.html)
    *   [Importing data](Importing_data.html)
    *   [Running R](Running_R.html)

Wednesday
=========

Our goal for the second part of the session is to set up repos, experiment with commiting, pushing and pulling, and share with the instructors.

* E-mail your GitHub user name to `bio708qmee@gmail.com`, if you haven't already done so.
* Work through chapters 9 and 12 in [Happy Git with R](https://happygitwithr.com/)
* Make a directory on the github repo called `QMEE`
	* Be aware that your repo is publicly readable by default.
* add Jonathan Dushoff (`@dushoff`) and Ben Bolker (`@bbolker`) as collaborators (`Settings` > `Collaborators` (left margin) > `Add collaborator`)

Assignment
==========

* Choose a data set that might be fun for you to explore for examples in this class (and possibly for the class project). Acquire the data (or make a plan to acquire it), and add a paragraph to the README.md file in your course repo describing it. Please give us some context for the data and describe the **biological** questions you would hope to answer (if you also want to translate your biological questions into statistical questions that's fine, but you should always start by framing the biological questions; the translation from biological to statistical questions is one of the hardest parts of data analysis).

* Input some piece of this data (use some public data set if your real one is not quickly available) into `R`, and do a substantive calculation using the data. You should upload a text file or spreadsheet, and an R script that reads it and does the calculation. You should confirm that these work "independently" before submitting by emailing the name of your main script to us at <bio708qmee@gmail.com>.
