= Intuitive answer =

* prior odds: 1/99 (against EBV)

* relative probability given the observation (positive test): 20/1

* posterior odds: 20/99

* posterior probability = 20/(99+20) = 20/119

= Formal answer =

== What are our a priori probabilities? ==
 
 Positive person with a positive test (PP):
 0.01*1 = 0.01

 PN: 0.01*0 = 0

 NP: 0.99*0.05

 NN: 0.99*0.95

 == What do the data tell us? ==

 The data say that we have a positive test, so PP and NP are the only possibilities.

 The prior probability of being positive and having a positive test was: PP/(PP+NP+PN+NN) = PP.

 When the data come, I can throw out the things that didn't happen from the denominator

 The posterior probability of being positive and having a positive test is: NP/(PP+NP) = 0.0495/(0.01+0.0495) = 99/119

 The same answer.

 == What do you tell your friend ==

 You don't tell your friend ''anything'' until you find out why he or she was given a test in the first place.  It is not the same situation as the first one.
