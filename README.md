## Workflow

__Under construction__

Directories with course content:
* <repo>/ contains the index document for the website
* admin contains administrative materials
* topics contains an overview page for each topic (roughly a week (or optional week) of the course
* lectures contains lecture material
* tips contains additional material from us

All of these directories follow the same rules to farm out material to corresponding subdirectories of docs/ which is where the github.io pages are served.

Some make rules:
* update_all is meant to remake the site
* push_all should push the main directory and all of the active subdirectories
* local_site opens a local-file-based version of the site
* old_site opens a local-file-based version of the 2019 site from the gh-pages directory

Consider using `make dateup` after pulling but before working; this will deal with time-stamp ambiguity and avoid attempts to remake things that you haven't worked on

Here are some other directories that we currently have:

* `data/` what it says
* `pix/`  miscellaneous non-workflow-generated images
* `oldSource/` 
* `makestuff/` machinery
* `html/` machinery
